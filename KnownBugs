Forced nickchanges may cause nick collisions between "Guest" nicks when there
is a large netburst that is processed extremely quickly by Services. This
should be fixed in the not-so-distant future.

Clone detection can give false warnings if a user connects and then signs
off several times in rapid succession.

Clone detection also goes off wrongly if a server links and has a number of
clients from the same hostname.

/msg OperServ RESTART / kill -HUP don't work sometimes.  SHUTDOWN /
kill -TERM (or just kill) still work in this case.  [Happens after
netsplits?]

If there is absolutely no activity on your network, Services may delay
timed events (nick kills, database saving, etc.) until the next message
comes in from Services' uplink server.
