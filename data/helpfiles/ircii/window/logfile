Usage: WINDOW LOGFILE [<filename>]
  Sets the name of the file to be used for the log of this window.
  New window logs are appended to the end of this file.

  Nothing is appended to this name, if you use WINDOW LOG.
  If you don't set a logfile for the window, and call WINDOW LOG,
  ircII creates a name for you.
