Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]FLOOD [-|^]<parameters> [action]
  The FLOOD type is activated whenever someone sends a lot of 
  information very rapidly to you, your channel, or the system at 
  large (ie: a wallop).  Usually, this is caused when someone dumps
  a file to your channel or to you.  The parameters for this are:
    $0	The nick of the flooder
    $1	The type of flooding being done 
    $2- The content of the flooding message

  General use for ON FLOOD is as follows:
    ON ^FLOOD *
  This will automatically prevent flooding messages from being 
  displayed and automatically disable itself when the flooding
  has stopped.

  If you use services like IRCIIHelp or NickServ, these can appear to
  IRCII as floods, but if you add to following ON lines:
    ON FLOOD ^IRCIIHelp
    ON FLOOD ^NickServ
  These will not be treated as floods and will let their messages through.

  Warning:  There are occasions where ON FLOOD can be inadvertantly 
  activated (such as after a net-burp, or after you have ^Z'd for a
  while).  Therefore, I strongly advise against using KILL or even
  KICK as the action taken by an ON FLOOD.
