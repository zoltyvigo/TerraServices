Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]DCC_CHAT [-|^]<paramters> [action]
  This is activated whenever you receive a DMSG from someone.
  The parameters for the action are as follows:
    $0    nickname of person who sent the DMSG
    $1-   The message

  Warning: As DMSG is outside the IRC protocol, it allows you to send
  a DMSG from an ON DCC_CHAT. This has the potential to create loops.
  If you intend to send a DMSG from DCC_CHAT you are responsible for
  ensuring that it will not create a loop.
