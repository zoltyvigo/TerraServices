Usage: ON [#|+|-|^|&|@]EXEC [-|^]<paramters> [action]
  This is activate whenever an EXEC'd process produces output
  to its standard output channel.  The process number is the
  number assigned by EXEC to the process (see HELP EXEC).  The
  parameters to this function are:
    $0	The process number that activated the ON
	If the EXEC was called with EXEC -name <process name>
	then $0 matches this name instead. This is very useful
	for keeping the processes separated out.
    $1-	The line of output to stdout
