Usage: INPUT "<prompt>" <command> <args>
  Where it displays "prompt" and then calls command, with args,
  and with the line prompted for as $*.  The use of this is
  strongly encouraged over the use of variable $"..". Similar
  problems that occur in /wait. E.g:
    ALIAS ex INPUT "Enter shell command >" exec $$*
