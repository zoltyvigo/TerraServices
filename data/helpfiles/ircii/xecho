Usage: XECHO [<flags>] <text>
  XECHO is like ECHO, except that it takes flag arguments.

Available flags:
  -LEVEL <level>  displays the message with the specified lastlog
                  level. This is useful to change the window some
                  messages are displayed in. This is the only way
                  to generate a message with the USERLOG1-4 lastlog
                  levels.
  -WINDOW <winname> displays the text in the named window, if it can. 
		  If the window doesn't exist, then the -WINDOW flag
 		  is ignored.
