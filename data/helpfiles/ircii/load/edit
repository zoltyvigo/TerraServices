Usage: LOAD edit
  Edit a loaded alias on the command line.
 
  Usage:  /edit alias_name
  This will take the matching alias and put it in the command
  line to be edited at will.  The alias name may be abreviated
  if there are no other matching aliases.

Note: If you are using a client version less than ircII2.2.2
  this script may not work reliably, as it has to define
  it's own 'xtype' alias.
