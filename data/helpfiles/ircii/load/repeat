Usage: LOAD repeat
  This is a sample of using the WHILE command in an alias.  Once
  loaded, here is it's usage:

Additionnal commands available:
  REPEAT <count> <cmd>
  This will perform <cmd> for the number of times specified by
  <count>. For example:
    REPEAT 5 /msg bigcheese Hello!
  This will send the message "Hello!" to bigcheese 5 times.  
  The above example can get annoying, so try to not to use
  this to really bother people.

Note: repeat is an excellent example of how to use the WHILE
  construct.   Included in this script is the RECREPEAT command
  which works just like REPEAT but does so using recursion.
  Both are good simple examples.
