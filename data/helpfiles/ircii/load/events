Usage: LOAD events
  This script contains a collection of ON commands which change the looks
  of some 'events' to something that I like more. Maybe you like it, too?

  The person's nickname that last sent you a message will appear in
  your status-line, if you have %U in your STATUS_FORMAT variable.
  The output of NAMES will look more compact.
  The output of WHO will look less confusing, too. Same goes for LIST.
  When you type to a channel your nickname will be displayed as prefix to
  the line instead of just '> '.
  You will be informed about the time every full hour.
