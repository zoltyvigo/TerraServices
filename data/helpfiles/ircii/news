        =============================================================
        The most important difference between this version and older
        ones is that the format for  ON SERVER_NOTICE and
        ON PUBLIC has changed.
        Some scripts won't work anymore  (may have strange effects).

	Also, for 2.2.3, the characters ^B ^V and ^_ mean different
	things - ^B bold, ^_ for underline, and ^V for inverse.

                             ircII 2.1.5      
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
> The command /who -h and -s is no more supported.
> Introduced { and } in scripts, see script/finger for an example.
See Also: /help load.
> Behavior of HOLD_MODE has changed, won't hold when you are being active
  in that window. I like it a lot more, it's not so disturbing anymore.
> Away messages are displayed only once, when talking to someone who is away
  unless you /set show_away_once off.
> You don't get disturbed by cryptic but trivial CTCP requests, unless
  you /set verbose_ctcp on.
> Improved handling of process prompts, but INPUT_PROMPT must be set.
> ircII can now load scripts and help files in compressed form.
> All the scripts have been updated and many helpfiles written and
rewritten.  Many bugs have been fixed, support of newer server features
added, this client is already 2.7-capable.

> There have been major changes in the command parser. Commands are not
expected to have a leading / unless entered interactively, if you
experience incompatibilities, you will have to add 'say' and 'send'
wherever you have made aliases that send to the channel or query.
See Also: /help ircII programming for this. Also the ';' has a new
meaning as command separator within ALIAS, BIND and ON. You might have
to \escape it.

> The good news: Scripts are much more readable and understandable, look
a lot less ugly now  :)   COMMAND_MODE gives command-oriented freaks the
chance to use ircII that way. A special script for MUDders has been added
that emulates an Aber/LPMUD-like environment on irc, without having to
type / before "smile" and allowing "'<text>" for "say" etc.

> CTCP ACTION has been implemented which permits you to send descriptions
of actions/'feelings' to other people on channels and even through
queries.  You can use it with /me and the action script.
