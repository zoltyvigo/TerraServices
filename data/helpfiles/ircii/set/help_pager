Usage: SET HELP_PAGER [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
  When set to OFF, the HELP function will not use it's built
  in paging mechanism but will use the normal window paging
  (hold mode).  If ON, then help uses it's own pager.
  Note: Note that if you have to use the help from a help service
  such as Help_US or help_AU then the setting of the HELP_PAGER 
  variable is irrelevant.  Use HOLD_MODE on instead to slow down 
  the output.
