Usage: SET NOVICE [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
  The NOVICE variable causes IRCII to disallow certain actions by the
  user (such as ON commands) and to show a request to read the NEWUSER
  help file on startup. It is set to ON by default, and should normally
  be turned off in your .ircrc file. Additionally, it enforces an
  automatic LEAVE before JOIN so that novice users are not confused
  by multiple channels.
