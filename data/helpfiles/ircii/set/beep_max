Usage: SET BEEP_MAX [<number of beeps>]
  This allows you to limit the maximum number of beeps you will hear
  for any given messages.  For example, if you set BEEP_MAX to 3,
  and someone sends a message with more than 10 beeps in it, you
  will only hear the first three.  Setting BEEP_MAX to 0 means
  you will hear all beeps in a message.
