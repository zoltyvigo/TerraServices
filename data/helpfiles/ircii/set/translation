Usage: SET TRANSLATION <character translation table>
  The TRANSLATION variable defines a character translation
  table.  By default, ircII assumes that all text processed
  over the network is in the ISO 8859/1 map, also known as
  Latin-1.  This is identical to standard ASCII, except that
  it is extended with additional characters in the range
  128-255.  Many environments by default use the Latin-1 map,
  such as X Windows, MS Windows, AmigaDOS, and modern ANSI
  terminals including Digital VT200, VT300, VT400 series and
  MS-Kermit.  However, many older environments use non-standard
  extensions to ASCII, and yet others use 7-bit national
  replacement sets.

  Some available settings for the TRANSLATION variable:

  8-bit sets:
    LATIN_1             ISO 8859/1.  Default.
    HP_MCS              Hewlett Packard Extended Roman 8.

                        anchors.
    CP437               Old IBM PC, compatibles and Atari ST.
    CP850               New IBM PC compatibles and IBM PS/2.
    DEC_MCS             DEC Multinational Character Set.
                        VAX/VMS.  VT320's and other 8-bit
                        Digital terminals use this set by
                        default, but I recommend changing to
                        Latin-1 in the terminal Set-Up.
