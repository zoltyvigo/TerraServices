*Usage: NOTE WALL [&<passwd>] [+|-<flags>] [+|-<maxtime>]
*			<nick!user@host> <msg>
*  WALL is an alias for USER +BR (default max 1 day)
*  This command is for sending a message once to every matching user
*  on IRC. Be careful using this command. WALL creates a list of 
*  persons received the message (and should not have it once more time)
*  with H flag set. This list can be displayed using ls +h from the
*  nick and username@host which the WALL request is queued from.
*  Removing the headers (H) before WALL request is removed would cause
*  the message to be sent once more to what users specified in list.
*  WALL +7 @*.edu Do not do this! - Makes it clear for all users using 
*  IRC on host @*.edu the next 7 days how stupid it is to send such WALL's ;)
