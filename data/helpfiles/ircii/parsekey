Usage: PARSEKEY <key function>
  The argument is one of the key functions, and the effect is the
  same as would be if you pressed a key bound to that function.
  These are the same functions as specififed when using BIND.  E.g.
    PARSEKEY ERASE_TO_BEG_OF_LINE   will execute that function
  just as though the key bound to that function had been pressed.
