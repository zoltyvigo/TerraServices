Usage: SENDLINE <line of text>
  SENDLINE will send a line to the client EXACTLY as though you had
  typed it at the command line.  However, unlike TYPE it is not
  displayed in the command line.  All alias expansion or command
  processing is done after it's sent as it normally would be when you 
  send a line with RETURN.  It can be used with ON ^INPUT
  if you're extremely careful.
