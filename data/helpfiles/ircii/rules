            Users Behavior on the Internet Relay Chat system



The Internet Relay Network (IRC) is a system for communicating with other
peoples.

IRC is a free speech system. Users may exchange viewpoints with other
users. But to protect people from abuse there are certain rules that the 
user MUST respect.

If a USER doesn't respect the guidelines/rules stated below, then the
IRC-ADMIN may suspend or reduce the availability for the USER.

These things are prohibited:

   * Using offensive words in channel topics.
    
   * Harassing another user. Harassment is defined as behavior towards 
     another user with the purpose of annoying them. 
     Harassment is a matter of opinion of the IRC-OP.

   * "Dumping" a lot of text to a channel.

   * Annoying another user or a channel with constant beeping. 

   * Any behavior reducing the functionality of IRC.

What kind of action a user is doing to break these rules are up to the 
IRC-OP to decide.

Violation should be straighted out via a civilized conversation between
the IRC-OP and the USER.
If the USER is not on-line then the USER should be notified by EMail.
If the USER wont respect what he's been told then it is up to the IRC-ADMIN 
what to do with the USER.

Many many problems can be avoided all together if the CHAN-OP puts necessary
restrictions on his/her channel or if the USER learns how to use IGNORE.

If someone finds a USER violating these rules he may contact the USER's
IRC-ADMIN.
To find a USERS IRC-ADMIN one may use the /ADMIN <nick-name>.
