                                What's New
               =============================================
               Summaries of changes in new Services versions

Note: This is intended to highlight only the major changes between
      versions.  For a complete list of changes, see the "Changes" file.

------------
Version 4.3:
------------
  + Due to a lack of time, Andy Church has handed over the maintenance and
    development of Services to myself, Andrew Kempe. To quote him, "I have
    (I hope) created something people find useful; I don't want to let it
    rot for my own lack of time to continue work on it." Although he's left
    large shoes to fill, I hope to continue his work in the same light. I'd
    also like to stress that even though I'm the new, quoted, "maintainer"
    (*cringe*) of services, I'm always open to constructive critisim,
    suggestions and the like. I hope Andy will remain associated with Services
    and it's development, even if only in a minor role/way. Andy, thanks for
    a great codebase upon which to develop! Finally, there will be a couple 
    of changes taking place, such as a new distribution site and a new mailing
    list address. These changes are detailed below.
  + New Services mailing list address: ircservices@ender.shadowfire.org
    Everyone who was on the old mailing list, as of 1999/08/12, has been moved
    to the new list. See section 9 of the README for information about using 
    this list.
  + New Services website:
  	http://ender.shadowfire.org/ircservices/
  + New Services distribution sites: 
  	Official: 	ftp://ender.shadowfire.org/pub/ircservices/
	Mirror:		ftp://ftp.electrocity.com/pub/ircservices/
    I will try to get all the previous versions of Services online there soon.
  + Services can now limit the number of client connections per hostname. This
    is intended to supercede the CheckClones code. It is also possible to 
    specify limits for specific hosts or hostmasks. Users causing the limit
    to be exceeded are killed.
  + Extended the INFO and AKICK commands.
    display hidden/additional information.
  + Services now supports DALnet's +r usermode and +r/+R channel modes.
  + See Changes.lang for a list of the new/modified language strings.

New configuration options:
  + NSSecureAdmins : When enabled, prevents the use of the DROP, GETPASS, and 
  	SET PASSWORD commands by Services admins on other Services admins or 
	the Services root.
  + WallExceptionExpire: Send a WALLOPS/GLOBOPS when an exception expires.
  + LimitSessions  : Enabled session limiting.
  + DefSessionLimit: Default session limit per hostname.
  + MaxSessionLimit: Maximum session limit for a session limit exception.
  + ExceptionExpiry: Default expiry time for a session limit exception.
  + SessionLimitExceeded: KILL message used when enforcing a session limit.
  + SessionLimitDetailsLoc: Message NOTICE'd to a user before they're killed to
  	enforce a session limit.

------------
Version 4.2:
------------
  + Default flags for newly registered nicks can now be configured via
	services.conf.
  + The NickServ LINK command can now be disabled via an option in
	services.conf.
  + Services admins can list all nicks linked to a given one.
  + Forbidden and no-expire nicks can be listed by Services admins with the
	NickServ LIST command.
  + Services will (optionally) log when a new user maximum is reached.
  + Services can now be configured to automatically kill users which
	trigger its clone detection.  This option is HIGHLY DISCOURAGED,
	however; see data/example.conf for details.

New configuration options:
  + NSDef...       : Default flags for newly registered nicknames.
  + NSEnforcerUser : Username/hostname for NickServ kill enforcement
	(previously "enforcer"@services.hostname).
  + NSDisableLinkCommand: Disables use of the NickServ LINK command.
  + NSListOpersOnly: Like ListOpersOnly, but only applies to NickServ.
  + NSListMax      : Maximum number of nicks displayed for NickServ LIST.
  + CSListOpersOnly: Like ListOpersOnly, but only applies to ChanServ.
  + CSListMax      : Maximum number of channels displayed for ChanServ LIST.
  + CSRestrictDelay: Amount of time to wait after startup before enforcing
	RESTRICTED/NOJOIN (only partially works).
  + WallAkillExpire: Send a WALLOPS/GLOBOPS when an autokill expires.
  + The clone kill option name has been intentionally omitted to force
	users to read the documentation before using it.

------------
Version 4.1:
------------
  + Most features of Services can now (finally!) be configured via a
	control file (like ircd's ircd.conf) rather than requiring changes
	to be made in config.h.  See the README for more information.
  + Added database importer to allow the use of databases created by other
	Services-like programs.
  + Added news system, allowing users to be sent a message when they
	connect to the network and/or /oper.
  + Added channel "successor" setting, allowing a "secondary founder" to be
	designated who will receive control of the channel if the founder's
	nick expires.
  + ChanServ will now send more informative error messages when users try
	to use the DALnet AOP and SOP commands.
  + Added ChanServ SET OPNOTICE and SET LEAVEOPS settings.
  + Several more list-type commands can use number lists and ranges
	(MemoServ LIST/READ, ChanServ ACCESS/AKICK LIST).
  + Command syntax error messages now obey the user's language setting.
  + Maximum user count is now dated and saved to disk.
  + Added vsnprintf() function for systems lacking a real one.
  * Database error-recovery improved.
  * Services now compiles warning-free (on all tested systems).

------------
Version 4.0:
------------
This release of Services has two major additions:

  + Multi-language support.  Services can now "speak" in multiple
	languages; each user can select (on a per-nick basis) which
	language they would like to receive messages from Services in,
	including help messages.  Currently supported languages are
	English, Japanese, Portugese, Spanish, and Turkish; translations
	into Afrikaans, Dutch, French, and Malaysian are underway.
  + Nick linking.  Nicknames can now be linked together, allowing a user to
	keep just one set of nickname settings and memos and have many
	different "aliases".  Any setting changes made to one of a set of
	linked nicks will immediately affect all of them; if one of a set
	of linked nicks is entered in (for example) a channel access list,
	then the user will have the same access level when using any nick
	in that set.

In addition, there is now a mailing list for Services discussion and
announcements.  To subscribe, send mail to services-request@dragonfire.net
with a subject of "subscribe" and a body of "subscribe <your-address>"
(without the angle brackets).  More information is at the bottom of the
README.

Services also has a World Wide Web site, located at:
	http://achurch.dragonfire.net/services/

Other notable additions/changes include:

  + Services will now track a user's IDENTIFY's across nick changes and
	network splits (on networks with some sort of timestamp support).
	An IDENTIFY now lasts until the user disconnects from IRC.
  + Channels can now receive memos.  By default, any user with access level
	10 or higher on a channel can list, read, and delete channel memos.
  + Users' last quit messages are now recorded and displayed in NickServ
	INFO.
  + Users can choose to hide parts of their nickname information from other
	users in the NickServ INFO display.
  + NickServ's SET KILL command now has QUICK and IMMED options to reduce
	the time before a kill to 20 seconds or kill immediately,
	respectively.  (However, the IMMED option is disabled by default in
	config.h.)
  + Nickname and channel URLs and E-mail addresses can be unset by passing
	no parameter.
  + A message can be set for a channel which will be /notice'd to a user
	when the user enters the channel.
  + Users can now set their own memo limits within the range 0 through
	DEF_MEMO_MAX with the SET LIMIT command.
  + The MemoServ DEL command now understands ranges (x-y) and commas.
  + MemoServ now has an INFO command, which reports the total number of
	memos, number of unread memos, and memo limit for the user giving
	the command.  Services admins can view that information for any
	user.
  + A new OperServ privilege level has been added: Services operator.  The
	OperServ MODE, KICK, and AKILL commands have been restricted to
	Services operators and above.
  + A new OperServ command has been added: CLEARMODES, for Services
	operators, which will clear all modes, bans, and optionally +o/+v
	from any channel.
  + Services admins can now disable expiration of specific nicknames and
	channels with the NickServ and ChanServ SET NOEXPIRE command, and
	can set any nick or channel parameters (including passwords)
	without needing to use the IDENTIFY command.
  + Services can now be configured to send a WALLOPS/GLOBOPS when the
	OperServ MODE, CLEARMODES, and/or KICK commands are used.
  * Services databases have been made portable; they can be moved from one
	machine / CPU type to another safely.
  * Services should now be happier about compiling under OS/2 and various
	different Unices.
  * Services now gets time zone information from the system rather than
	requiring it to be defined in config.h or given on the command line.


------------
Version 3.3:
------------
Version 3.3 is primarily a maintenance release, getting a lot of bug fixes
out and significantly optimizing the code.  Other notable changes:

  + MemoServ LIST and READ commands have new forms: LIST NEW and READ LAST.
  + Nicknames now have a PRIVATE flag, preventing them from appearing in
	LIST results.
  + Nicknames' last-seen times are now updated periodically while a nick's
	owner is online.
  + Network reads and writes are now buffered.
  * Channel auto-voice is now enabled by default at an access level of 3.
  * NickServ STATUS output changed; the word "STATUS" is now included at
	the beginning of each line.


------------
Version 3.2:
------------

  + URL and E-mail address fields added to nickname and channel records.
  + Frequency-of-use limit added to NickServ REGISTER command, much like
	the frequency-of-use limit on MemoServ SEND command.
  + Services admins can now be set online (using the OperServ ADMIN
	command), and no longer need to be defined in config.h.
  + OperServ RESTART command added to allow Services to be terminated and
	restarted without needing command-line intervention.
  * ~ at the beginning of a username (added by many IRC servers when an
	ident response is not received) is no longer ignored, which
	eliminates channel autokick problems on such servers.
  * IRC server message processing code modularized, which should simplify
	adding support for additional protocols.
  * More bugs squashed, as usual.


------------
Version 3.1:
------------

  + A limit can be set on the number of memos a nick can keep, and the
	limit can be varied or removed on a per-nick basis.
  + A limit can be set on the maximum number of channels a nick can
	register.  (This is not yet settable on a per-nick basis.)
  + The permissible frequency of use of the MemoServ SEND command can be
	set to prevent (or at least limit) memo flooding; for example, the
	default configuration prevents users from using the SEND command
	more often than once every five seconds.
  + Memo notification can be enabled or disabled on a per-nick basis.
  + OperServ autokills can be set to expire after a certain period of time,
	and can default to either not expiring or to having a certain
	duration.
  + Slightly increased protocol support: basic support for ircd.dal 4.4.x
	(x >= 15) is now present, as is support for the ircu GLINE command.
	Services should also work better with classic irc2.x servers.
  * Clone detection actually works now.
  * Many, many bugs fixed, as usual.  Also removed a typo in os-help.c that
	somehow made it into the 3.0.10 distribution.


------------
Version 3.0: (changes since 2.2.26)
------------

  + ChanServ access levels can finally be customized!  ChanServ has a new
	command, LEVELS, which allows the numeric access levels to be
	fine-tuned for each channel.  There are 11 settings available,
	each of which corresponds to a particular ChanServ command or
	function; for example, one can set the level at which users are
	automatically opped, and one can define a level at which users
	are to be automatically voiced as well.
  + Services admins can now view channel access and autokick lists and
	nickname access lists.
  + Read-only mode can now be set (and unset) both from the command line
	and during operation.
  * Channel access lists may now only contain registered nicknames; this
	allows Services to run much faster and simplifies channel access
	checks.
  * Numerous bugs, memory leaks, and potential security holes squashed.
